# Literature_analyzer
This is a set of tools for analyzing the literature of Russia, being developed by students of the physical technical high school.
The idea is, firstable, to write an automatical downloader of literature creations from a special site (https://royallib.com/).
After that, we should apply different filters and to add some features from the list:
1)
2)
3)

Note: significant amount of c++ code is sutuated locally and being modified. It is used in many projects, so, it cannot be in this repository. SEE IT HERE: https://github.com/donRumata03/My-Cpp-Libs
